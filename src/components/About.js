                                As a Backend Java Developer at Sitrack, I have the privilege of blending my passion for programming with my academic background in Electronic Engineering at the National Technological University FRM. In my day-to-day work, I leverage this fusion of skills to contribute to innovative and challenging projects. Beyond the realms of work and academia, my curiosity for technology has led me to immerse myself in the fascinating world of Machine Learning. I dedicate myself self-taughtly to exploring its concepts, algorithms, and applications, always seeking new ways to expand my knowledge and apply it creatively in my work and personal projects. This combination of practical experience and continuous learning not only drives me professionally but also fuels my enthusiasm to continue discovering the boundaries of technology and its potential to transform the world.
